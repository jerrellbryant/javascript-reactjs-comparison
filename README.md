# Javascript React Comparison

Build three simple apps to do a comparison between Vanilla javascript and React.js

1. Black Jack app
2. Calculator app
3. Tracker chrome extension app

I was intrigued with the idea after watching this video [JS framework comparison](https://youtu.be/cuHDQhDhvPE) on YouTube.
